# Visual-Basic-Manual-File-Syncer-Via-GitHub
A manual file syncer via GitHub in visual basic. Originally written to sync ULTRAKILL save files between computers using features native to Windows without the need for third party software. I doubt anyone would need to use this exact solution but I figured I'd upload it nonetheless.



Follow the directions in each .vbs file. You're intended to run DownloadSave.vbs followed by ExtractSave.vbs, and then UploadSaves.vbs once you want to upload them to GitHub. This runs natively on Windows without the need for third party software.

I have not yet tested the publically modified version of this code, so write a new issue if it does not work as intended or is not clear enough.

I probably spent more time making this repository than actually modifying code from online forums to make these scripts.
